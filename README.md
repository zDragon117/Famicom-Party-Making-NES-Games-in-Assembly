I prefer a book-like edition, so I made this:

[https://github.com/zDragon117/book-Famicom-Party-Making-NES-Games-in-Assembly](https://github.com/zDragon117/book-Famicom-Party-Making-NES-Games-in-Assembly)

A small change I made is mention of the modern NES game Micro Mages released in 2019 which is an excellent game.

And I am hoping that someday my NES game will be mentioned too.

### Changelog:
#### 2nd edition:
-   Edit the cover.
-   Use font QT Korrin like the website.
-   Update content with a new emulator (Mesen2) and new graphics tool (NEXXT)
-   Add Part III Gameplay: Chapters 16 and 17.
